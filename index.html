                       <p>
                        Hi! I'm a 25-year old waiter, , writer, actor, runner... the list goes on and on. Most recently, I became a programmer (an amateur, but still a programmer)! While learning the full-stack is my guding principle and bootcamp goal, I plan to specialize in UIUX design! I'd like to improve my skills at creating functioning, beautiful websites with the User always in mind. It's my hope that I'll continue to develop my UIUX skills while I press on in the course of this bootcamp. If you'd like to take a look at some of my work, look at the section below. Hope to hear from you soon!
